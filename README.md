# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes using patient data.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes. The model is built using Python and several key libraries.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `svm`
- `StandardScaler`
- `train_test_split`
- `accuracy_score`

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Dataset link or name]
- **Description:** The dataset includes various patient attributes such as age, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, etc.
